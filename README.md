# MarvelVerse

Original Design:
- A web application built using JavaScript and React which was deployed on Heroku. 
- The application utilizes API from superheroapi.com to get characters from different comic universes.
- The project was made to showcase charactersâ€™ appearances in comics, stats, identity, and personal traits.

Upcoming changes:
- Moving the application to build upon JavaScript, NextJS, and later be deployed on render.com.
- Alternating to Marvel API, as the API is a lot more organized and stable in comparison to superheroapi.com.
